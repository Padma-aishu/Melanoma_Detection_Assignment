# MELANOMA DETECTION ASSIGNMENT
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- The training accuracy seems to be nearly ~90%.
- The validation accuracy is nearly ~80%.
- Though the model accuracy has improved, the class rebalance has helped treat the overfitting to some extent.
- Much better models could be built or tried out using more epochs and more layers.
